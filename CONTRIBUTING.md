## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (or compatible)
- Git
- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of Linux security concepts

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ssfdre38/SecureOS.git
cd SecureOS

# Install development dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-venv git

# Create virtual environment for Python development
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

---

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy

- `master` - Stable, production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - Feature development
- `bugfix/bug-name` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/issue-name` - Critical fixes

### Workflow

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Follow coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Target the `develop` branch
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Link related issues

---

## Coding Standards

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where possible
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes

**Example:**

```python
def analyze_threat(event: Dict, threshold: float = 0.85) -> Dict:
    """
    Analyze security event for potential threats.
    
    Args:
        event: Security event data dictionary
        threshold: Confidence threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If event data is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Shell Scripts

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Enable strict mode: `set -euo pipefail`
- Quote variables: `"$variable"`
- Use meaningful variable names in UPPER_CASE
- Add comments for complex logic

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Configure security settings
configure_security() {
    local config_file="$1"
    local setting_value="$2"
    
    echo "Configuring $config_file..."
    # Implementation
}
```

### Markdown

- Use ATX-style headers (`#` not underlines)
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use code blocks with language specification
- Keep line length reasonable for readability

---

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run full test suite
sudo bash scripts/test-suite.sh

# Test specific component
python3 v5.0.0/ai-threat-detection/secureos-ai-engine.py test
```

### Writing Tests

- Add unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for new features
- Ensure tests are reproducible
- Mock external dependencies

**Example Test:**

```python
def test_threat_detection():
    """Test AI threat detection functionality"""
    engine = ThreatDetectionEngine()
    
    test_event = {
        'syscall_count': 150,
        'network_connections': 5,
        'process_spawns': 2
    }
    
    result = engine.analyze_event(test_event)
    
    assert 'threat_type' in result
    assert 'confidence' in result
    assert 0 <= result['confidence'] <= 1
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test both success and failure cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

---

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- All public functions must have docstrings
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Include usage examples for complex functions
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add examples to QUICKSTART.md
- Document configuration options
- Include troubleshooting tips

### Changelog

Update CHANGELOG.md with:
- New features (Added)
