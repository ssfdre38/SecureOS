## ‚è≥ Pending Actions (Require Your Involvement)

### 1. DNS Configuration (CRITICAL - Do This First!)

**Login to your domain registrar** where you purchased `secureos.xyz` and add these DNS records:

#### A Records (for apex domain secureos.xyz)
```
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.108.153, TTL: 3600
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.109.153, TTL: 3600  
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.110.153, TTL: 3600
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.111.153, TTL: 3600
```

#### CNAME Record (for www subdomain)
```
Type: CNAME, Name: www, Value: secureos.xyz, TTL: 3600
```

#### CNAME Record (for packages subdomain - optional)
```
Type: CNAME, Name: packages, Value: ssfdre38.github.io, TTL: 3600
```

**DNS propagation takes 24-48 hours!**

### 2. Enable Custom Domain in GitHub Pages

**After DNS propagates**, go to:
https://github.com/ssfdre38/secureos.github.io/settings/pages

Then:
1. Under "Custom domain", enter: `secureos.xyz`
2. Click "Save"
3. Wait for DNS check to complete
4. Check "Enforce HTTPS" (after DNS is verified)

### 3. GitHub Pages Deployment

The website may take 5-10 minutes to deploy initially. You can check status at:
https://github.com/ssfdre38/secureos.github.io/actions

Current temporary URL (until domain is configured):
https://ssfdre38.github.io/secureos.github.io/

---

## üîç Verification Steps

### Check Website Deployment
```bash
# Check if GitHub Pages is live (may take 5-10 minutes)
curl -I https://ssfdre38.github.io/secureos.github.io/

# After DNS configuration, check custom domain
curl -I https://secureos.xyz
```

### Verify DNS Configuration
```bash
# Check A records
dig secureos.xyz A

# Check CNAME for www
dig www.secureos.xyz CNAME

# Check packages subdomain
dig packages.secureos.xyz CNAME
```

### Verify CNAME File
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssfdre38/secureos.github.io/main/CNAME
# Should output: secureos.xyz
```

---

## üì¶ Next Development Steps

### ISO Building

When ready to build the ISO:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/SecureOS
sudo bash scripts/build_iso.sh
```

Or use GitHub Actions:
1. Create a release tag: `git tag v4.0.0 && git push origin v4.0.0`
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build the ISO
3. ISO will be uploaded to GitHub Releases

### Package Repository Setup

To host packages at `packages.secureos.xyz`:

**Option 1: GitHub Pages (for small packages)**
- Upload packages to secureos-packages repository
- Configure as GitHub Pages

**Option 2: VPS Hosting (recommended for large packages)**
- Point DNS to your VPS
- Configure nginx/Apache
- Set up APT repository structure
- Enable SSL with Let's Encrypt
